# It's Not Just a Bounce Charge of ₹500: The True Cost of a Falling CIBIL Score

A declining CIBIL score is more than just a financial inconvenience—it can seriously impact your mental peace. While a small overdue or bounced payment might seem trivial, the long-term effects can be far-reaching and costly. If your CIBIL score falls below 770, you may be charged 0.3% to 1% extra interest on loans, even if your score isn’t terrible. Let’s explore how this affects your finances and mental well-being.

## The Financial Impact of a Low CIBIL Score

Here’s a real-world example to understand the cost:

- **Loan Amount**: ₹10,00,000 (Personal Loan)  
- **Loan Tenure**: 5 Years  
- **Interest Rate with Good CIBIL Score**: 11.25%  
- **Interest Rate with Lower CIBIL Score**: 12.5% (1% higher)

Using the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) formula, let’s calculate the extra money paid:

- **Extra Interest Paid**: ₹30,000 over 5 years  

This additional amount could have been saved or invested elsewhere. Over time, these costs add up, making a falling CIBIL score far more expensive than it initially appears.

## Why Fixing Your CIBIL Score Is Time-Consuming

Improving your CIBIL score isn’t an overnight process. Once you take corrective steps, it typically takes:

- **Minimum Time**: 2 months  
- **Potential Time**: Longer, as CIBIL updates reflect changes slowly.

This delay adds to the frustration and uncertainty, impacting your mental peace.

## A Personal Experience: The Cost of ₹5 Overdue

I once faced an issue with an overdue amount of ₹5, even though my loan was closed 4 years ago, and I had a No Dues Certificate from the bank. To fix this:

1. **Dispute Raised via CIBIL Website**:  
   I had to create an account on the [CIBIL website](https://www.cibil.com/).  
   
   - **Cost**: Minimum ₹550 for a one-month subscription  
   - **Reality**: It takes at least 45 days for the CIBIL score to reflect changes, so a ₹800 subscription (6 months access) is more practical.

2. **Resolution Timeline**:  
   - The process was slow and required consistent follow-up.  
   - The mental stress of waiting for corrections was significant.

## Takeaways

### Hidden Costs
- Falling CIBIL scores lead to higher interest rates, costing thousands over time.  
- Fixing your score involves monetary and emotional investment.

### Mental Stress
The time, money, and effort spent on resolving disputes can cause significant anxiety and frustration. It’s not just about finances—it’s about peace of mind.

## Final Thoughts

Maintaining a good CIBIL score isn’t just about avoiding bounce charges; it’s about safeguarding your financial health and mental well-being. Stay proactive with timely payments and regularly check your CIBIL score to avoid costly surprises. Remember, even small lapses can lead to big consequences.
