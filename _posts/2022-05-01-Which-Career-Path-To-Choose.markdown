Which Career Path To Choose?
========

Picking the right career is one of the most important decision you ever make in your life. When you take wrong career you waste lots of time, sometimes many year, then you finally realise one day that you are not best at what you have been doing and life seems boring to you. For example, you took some major in your college and later you realise that you don't like that subject or you see bleak future in that or feel that it's too competitive for you to excel in that field. It might also be the case that you are doing some job and you are not enjoying the work. This way your life appears boring as you see no future on what you have been doing.
If you have any of these or related symptoms then you have not tried enough things in your life. This confused state is mostly encountered by youngsters. So the best way to know your career path is to explore as many areas as you can, like teaching, management, coding, painting, starting new business, internship in some field, blogging, book writing, driving, marketing, farming, selling products, Adventurous job, Field work, etc. and try some of them unless a relaxing voice comes from inside which says I am enjoying my life and now there is no worry because things are under my control.
